Commands for working with Salesforce orgs. As the Salesforce CLI is transitioning commands owned by various teams to
open source, it may not represent all of the `org` commands.

## About Salesforce CLI plugins

Salesforce CLI plugins are based on the [oclif plugin framework](https://oclif.io/docs/introduction). Read
the [plugin developer guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_plugins.meta/sfdx_cli_plugins/cli_plugins_architecture_sf_cli.htm)
to learn about Salesforce CLI plugin development.

This repository contains a lot of additional scripts and tools to help with general Salesforce node development and
enforce coding standards. You should familiarize yourself with some of
the [node developer packages](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-dev-packages/) used by Salesforce. There is also a
default circleci config using the [release management orb](https://github.com/forcedotcom/npm-release-management-orb)
standards.

Additionally, there are some additional tests that the Salesforce CLI will enforce if this plugin is ever bundled with
the CLI. These test are included by default under the `posttest` script and it is recommended to keep these tests active
in your plugin, regardless if you plan to have it bundled.

This plugin is bundled with the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli). For more information
on the CLI, read
the [getting started guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm).

We always recommend using the latest version of these commands bundled with the CLI, however, you can install a specific
version or tag if needed.

## Install

```bash
sf plugins:install @salesforce/plugin-org
```

### CLA

External contributors will be required to sign a Contributor's License
Agreement. You can do so by going to <https://cla.salesforce.com/sign-cla>.

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-org

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/dev` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/dev force:org:list
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be
useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sf cli
sf plugins:link .
# To verify
sf plugins
```

### Sandbox NUTs

Sandboxes are pretty slow, and there's a constraint to how many we can have. So if your changes might impact sandboxes,
and you want to check those in the real world, run
the [SandboxNuts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-org/actions/workflows/sandboxNuts.yml) Github Action.

DESCRIPTION
  Create a sandbox org.

  There are two ways to create a sandbox org: specify a definition file that contains the sandbox options or use the
  --name and --license-type flags to specify the two required options. If you want to set an option other than name or
  license type, such as apexClassId, you must use a definition file.

ALIASES
  $ sf env create sandbox

EXAMPLES
  Create a sandbox org using a definition file and give it the alias "MyDevSandbox". The production org that contains
  the sandbox license has the alias "prodOrg".

    $ sf org create sandbox -f config/dev-sandbox-def.json --alias MyDevSandbox --target-org prodOrg

  Create a sandbox org by directly specifying its name and type of license (Developer) instead of using a definition
  file. Set the sandbox org as your default.

    $ sf org create sandbox --name mysandbox --license-type Developer --alias MyDevSandbox --target-org prodOrg \
      --set-default

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --alias=<value>  Alias for the sandbox org.

    When you create a sandbox, the generated usernames are based on the usernames present in the production org. To
    ensure uniqueness, the new usernames are appended with the name of the sandbox. For example, the username
    "user@example.com" in the production org results in the username "user@example.com.mysandbox" in a sandbox named
    "mysandbox". When you set an alias for a sandbox org, it's assigned to the resulting username of the user running
    this command.

  -c, --clone=<value>  Name of the sandbox org to clone.

    The value of clone must be an existing sandbox in the same target-org.

  -f, --definition-file=<value>  Path to a sandbox definition file.

    The sandbox definition file is a blueprint for the sandbox. You can create different definition files for each
    sandbox type that you use in the development process. See
    <https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_sandbox_definition.htm> for all
    the options you can specify in the defintion file.

  -n, --name=<value>  Name of the sandbox org.

    The name must be a unique alphanumeric string (10 or fewer characters) to identify the sandbox. You canâ€™t reuse a
    name while a sandbox is in the process of being deleted.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Username or alias of the production org that contains the sandbox license.

    When it creates the sandbox org, Salesforce copies the metadata, and optionally data, from your production org to
    the new sandbox org.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the sandbox org to be ready.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal to you and displays
    the "sf org resume sandbox" command you run to check the status of the create. The displayed command includes the
    job ID for the running sandbox creation.

  --async  Request the sandbox creation, but don't wait for it to complete.

    The command immediately displays the job ID and returns control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue
    to use the CLI. To check the status of the sandbox creation, run "sf org resume sandbox".

  --no-track-source  Do not use source tracking for this sandbox.

    We recommend you enable source tracking in Developer and Developer Pro sandbox, which is why it's the default
    behavior. Source tracking allows you to track the changes you make to your metadata, both in your local project and
    in the sandbox, and to detect any conflicts between the two.

    To disable source tracking in the new sandbox, specify the --no-track-source flag. The main reason to disable source
    tracking is for performance. For example, while you probably want to deploy metadata and run Apex tests in your
    CI/CD jobs, you probably don't want to incur the costs of source tracking (checking for conflicts, polling the
    SourceMember object, various file system operations.) This is a good use case for disabling source tracking in the
    sandbox.

DESCRIPTION
  Create a scratch org.

  There are two ways to create a scratch org: either specify a definition file that contains the options or use the
  --edition flag to specify the one required option.

  For either method, you can also use these flags; if you use them with --definition-file, they override their
  equivalent option in the scratch org definition file:

  * --description
  * --name  (equivalent to the "orgName" option)
  * --username
  * --release
  * --edition
  * --admin-email (equivalent to the "adminEmail" option)
  * --source-org (equivalent to the "sourceOrg" option)

  If you want to set options other than the preceding ones, such as org features or settings, you must use a definition
  file.

  You must specify a Dev Hub to create a scratch org, either with the --target-dev-hub flag or by setting your default
  Dev Hub with the target-dev-hub configuration variable.

ALIASES
  $ sf env create scratch

EXAMPLES
  Create a Developer edition scratch org using your default Dev Hub and give the scratch org an alias:

    $ sf org create scratch --edition developer --alias my-scratch-org

  Create a scratch org with a definition file. Specify the Dev Hub using its alias, set the scratch org as your
  default, and specify that it expires in 3 days:

    $ sf org create scratch --target-dev-hub MyHub --definition-file config/project-scratch-def.json --set-default \
      --duration-days 3

  Create a preview Enterprise edition scratch org; for use only during Salesforce release transition periods:

    $ sf org create scratch --edition enterprise --alias my-scratch-org --target-dev-hub MyHub --release preview

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --alias=<value>  Alias for the scratch org.

    New scratch orgs include one administrator by default. The admin user's username is auto-generated and looks
    something like test-wvkpnfm5z113@example.com. When you set an alias for a new scratch org, it's assigned this
    username.

  -e, --edition=developer|enterprise|group|professional|partner-developer|partner-enterprise|partner-group|partner-professional

    Salesforce edition of the scratch org. Overrides the value of the "edition" option in the definition file, if set.

    The editions that begin with "partner-" are available only if the Dev Hub org is a Partner Business Org.

  -f, --definition-file=<value>  Path to a scratch org definition file.

    The scratch org definition file is a blueprint for the scratch org. It mimics the shape of an org that you use in
    the development life cycle, such as acceptance testing, packaging, or production. See
    <https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_scratch_orgs_def_file.htm> for
    all the option you can specify in the definition file.

  -t, --[no-]track-source  Use source tracking for this scratch org. Set --no-track-source to disable source tracking.

    We recommend you enable source tracking in scratch orgs, which is why it's the default behavior. Source tracking
    allows you to track the changes you make to your metadata, both in your local project and in the scratch org, and to
    detect any conflicts between the two.

    To disable source tracking in the new scratch org, specify the --no-track-source flag. The main reason to disable
    source tracking is for performance. For example, while you probably want to deploy metadata and run Apex tests in
    your CI/CD jobs, you probably don't want to incur the costs of source tracking (checking for conflicts, polling the
    SourceMember object, various file system operations.) This is a good use case for disabling source tracking in the
    scratch org.

  -v, --target-dev-hub=<value>  Username or alias of the Dev Hub org.

    Overrides the value of the target-dev-hub configuration variable, if set.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the scratch org to be ready.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal to you and displays
    the job ID. To resume the scratch org creation, run the org resume scratch command and pass it the job ID.

  --async  Request the org, but don't wait for it to complete.

    The command immediately displays the job ID and returns control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue
    to use the CLI. To resume the scratch org creation, run "sf org resume scratch".

  --release=preview|previous  Release of the scratch org as compared to the Dev Hub release.

    By default, scratch orgs are on the same release as the Dev Hub. During Salesforce release transition periods, you
    can override this default behavior and opt in or out of the new release.

  --username=<value>

    Username of the scratch org admin user. Overrides the value of the "username" option in the definition file, if set.

    The username must be unique within the entire scratch org and sandbox universe. You must add your own logic to
    ensure uniqueness.

    Omit this flag to have Salesforce generate a unique username for your org.
```

## `sf org delete sandbox`

Delete a sandbox.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org delete sandbox -o <value> [--json] [-p]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Sandbox alias or login user.
  -p, --no-prompt           Don't prompt the user to confirm the deletion.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Delete a sandbox.

  Salesforce CLI marks the org for deletion in the production org that contains the sandbox licenses and then deletes
  all local references to the org from your computer.
  Specify a sandbox with either the username you used when you logged into it, or the alias you gave the sandbox when
  you created it. Run "sf org list" to view all your orgs, including sandboxes, and their aliases.
  Both the sandbox and the associated production org must already be authenticated with the CLI to successfully delete
  the sandbox.

ALIASES
  $ sf env delete sandbox

EXAMPLES
  Delete a sandbox with alias my-sandbox:

    $ sf org delete sandbox --target-org my-sandbox

  Specify a username instead of an alias:

    $ sf org delete sandbox --target-org myusername@example.com.qa

  Delete the sandbox without prompting to confirm:

    $ sf org delete sandbox --target-org my-sandbox --no-prompt
```

_See code: [lib/commands/org/delete/sandbox.ts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-org/blob/3.2.1/lib/commands/org/delete/sandbox.ts)_

## `sf org delete scratch`

Delete a scratch org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org delete scratch -o <value> [--json] [-p]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Scratch org alias or login user.
  -p, --no-prompt           Don't prompt the user to confirm the deletion.

GLOBAL FLAGS

## `sf org disable tracking`

Prevent Salesforce CLI from tracking changes in your source files between your project and an org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org disable tracking -o <value> [--json]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Username or alias of the target org. Not required if the `target-org`
                            configuration variable is already set.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Prevent Salesforce CLI from tracking changes in your source files between your project and an org.

  Disabling source tracking has no direct effect on the org, it affects only your local environment. Specifically,
  Salesforce CLI stores the setting in the org's local configuration file so that no source tracking operations are
  executed when working with the org.

EXAMPLES
  Disable source tracking for an org with alias "myscratch":

    $ sf org disable tracking --target-org myscratch

  Disable source tracking for an org using a username:

    $ sf org disable tracking --target-org you@example.com

  Disable source tracking for your default org:

    $ sf org disable tracking
```

_See code: [lib/commands/org/disable/tracking.ts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-org/blob/3.2.1/lib/commands/org/disable/tracking.ts)_

## `sf org display`

Display information about an org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org display -o <value> [--json] [--api-version <value>] [--verbose]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>   (required) Username or alias of the target org. Not required if the `target-org`
                             configuration variable is already set.
      --api-version=<value>  Override the api version used for api requests made by this command
      --verbose              Display the sfdxAuthUrl property.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Display information about an org.

  Output includes your access token, client Id, connected status, org ID, instance URL, username, and alias, if
  applicable.

  Use --verbose to include the SFDX auth URL. WARNING: The SFDX auth URL contains sensitive information, such as a
  refresh token that can be used to access an org. Don't share or distribute this URL or token.

  Including --verbose displays the sfdxAuthUrl property only if you authenticated to the org using "org login web" (not
  "org login jwt").

ALIASES
  $ sf force org display

EXAMPLES
  Display information about your default org:

    $ sf org display

  Display information, including the sfdxAuthUrl property, about the org with alias TestOrg1:

    $ sf org display --target-org TestOrg1 --verbose
```

_See code: [lib/commands/org/display.ts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-org/blob/3.2.1/lib/commands/org/display.ts)_

## `sf org enable tracking`

Allow Salesforce CLI to track changes in your source files between your project and an org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org enable tracking -o <value> [--json]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>  (required) Username or alias of the target org. Not required if the `target-org`
                            configuration variable is already set.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Allow Salesforce CLI to track changes in your source files between your project and an org.

  Enabling source tracking has no direct effect on the org, it affects only your local environment. Specifically,
  Salesforce CLI stores the setting in the org's local configuration file so that source tracking operations are
  executed when working with the org.

  This command throws an error if the org doesn't support tracking. Examples of orgs that don't support source tracking
  include Developer Edition orgs, production orgs, Partial Copy sandboxes, and Full sandboxes.

EXAMPLES
  Enable source tracking for an org with alias "myscratch":

    $ sf org enable tracking --target-org myscratch

  Enable source tracking for an org using a username:

    $ sf org enable tracking --target-org you@example.com

  Enable source tracking for your default org:

    $ sf org enable tracking
```

_See code: [lib/commands/org/enable/tracking.ts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-org/blob/3.2.1/lib/commands/org/enable/tracking.ts)_

## `sf org list`

List all orgs youâ€™ve created or authenticated to.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org list [--json] [--verbose] [--all] [-p --clean] [--skip-connection-status]

FLAGS
  -p, --no-prompt               Don't prompt for confirmation.
      --all                     Include expired, deleted, and unknown-status scratch orgs.
      --clean                   Remove all local org authorizations for non-active scratch orgs. Use "org logout" to
                                remove non-scratch orgs.
      --skip-connection-status  Skip retrieving the connection status of non-scratch orgs.
      --verbose                 List more information about each org.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

ALIASES
  $ sf force org list

EXAMPLES
  List all orgs you've created or authenticated to:

    $ sf org list

DESCRIPTION
  List the metadata components and properties of a specified type.

  Use this command to identify individual components in your manifest file or if you want a high-level view of
  particular metadata types in your org. For example, you can use this command to return a list of names of all the
  CustomObject or Layout components in your org, then use this information in a retrieve command that returns a subset
  of these components.

  The username that you use to connect to the org must have the Modify All Data or Modify Metadata Through Metadata API
  Functions permission.

ALIASES
  $ sf force mdapi listmetadata

EXAMPLES
  List the CustomObject components, and their properties, in the org with alias "my-dev-org":

    $ sf org list metadata --metadata-type CustomObject --target-org my-dev-org

  List the CustomObject components in your default org, write the output to the specified file, and use API version
  57.0:

    $ sf org list metadata --metadata-type CustomObject --api-version 57.0 --output-file /path/to/outputfilename.txt

  List the Dashboard components in your default org that are contained in the "folderSales" folder, write the output
  to the specified file, and use API version 57.0:

    $ sf org list metadata --metadata-type Dashboard --folder folderSales --api-version 57.0 --output-file \
      /path/to/outputfilename.txt

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  --api-version=<value>  API version to use; default is the most recent API version.

    Override the api version used for api requests made by this command

  --folder=<value>

    Folder associated with the component; required for components that use folders; folder names are case-sensitive.

    Examples of metadata types that use folders are Dashboard, Document, EmailTemplate, and Report.
```

## `sf org list metadata-types`

Display details about the metadata types that are enabled for your org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org list metadata-types -o <value> [--json] [--api-version <value>] [-f <value>]

FLAGS
  -f, --output-file=<value>  Pathname of the file in which to write the results.
  -o, --target-org=<value>   (required) Username or alias of the target org. Not required if the `target-org`
                             configuration variable is already set.
      --api-version=<value>  API version to use; default is the most recent API version.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Display details about the metadata types that are enabled for your org.

  The information includes Apex classes and triggers, custom objects, custom fields on standard objects, tab sets that
  define an app, and many other metadata types. Use this information to identify the syntax needed for a <name> element
  in a manifest file (package.xml).

  The username that you use to connect to the org must have the Modify All Data or Modify Metadata Through Metadata API
  Functions permission.

ALIASES
  $ sf force mdapi describemetadata

EXAMPLES
  Display information about all known and enabled metadata types in the org with alias "my-dev-org" using API version
  57.0:

    $ sf org list metadata-types --api-version 57.0 --target-org my-dev-org

  Display only the metadata types that aren't yet supported by Salesforce CLI in your default org and write the
  results to the specified file:

    $ sf org list metadata-types --output-file /path/to/outputfilename.txt --filter-known

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -f, --output-file=<value>  Pathname of the file in which to write the results.

    Directing the output to a file makes it easier to extract relevant information for your package.xml manifest file.
    The default output destination is the terminal or command window console.

  --api-version=<value>  API version to use; default is the most recent API version.

    Override the api version used for api requests made by this command

Open your default scratch org, or another specified org, in a browser.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org open -o <value> [--json] [--api-version <value>] [-b chrome|edge|firefox | -r] [-p <value> | -f
    <value>]

FLAGS
  -b, --browser=<option>     Browser where the org opens.
                             <options: chrome|edge|firefox>
  -f, --source-file=<value>  Path to an ApexPage or FlexiPage to open in Lightning App Builder.
  -o, --target-org=<value>   (required) Username or alias of the target org. Not required if the `target-org`
                             configuration variable is already set.
  -p, --path=<value>         Navigation URL path to open a specific page.
  -r, --url-only             Display navigation URL, but donâ€™t launch browser.
      --api-version=<value>  Override the api version used for api requests made by this command

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Open your default scratch org, or another specified org, in a browser.

  To open a specific page, specify the portion of the URL after "https://mydomain.my.salesforce.com" as the value for
  the --path flag. For example, specify "--path lightning" to open Lightning Experience, or specify "--path
  /apex/YourPage" to open a Visualforce page.

  Use the --source-file to open a Lightning Page from your local project in Lightning App Builder. Lightning page files
  have the suffix .flexipage-meta.xml, and are stored in the "flexipages" directory.

  To generate a URL but not launch it in your browser, specify --url-only.

  To open in a specific browser, use the --browser flag. Supported browsers are "chrome", "edge", and "firefox". If you
  don't specify --browser, the org opens in your default browser.

ALIASES
  $ sf force org open
  $ sf force source open

EXAMPLES
  Open your default org in your default browser:

    $ sf org open

  Open the org with alias MyTestOrg1 in the Firefox browser:

    $ sf org open --target-org MyTestOrg1 --browser firefox

  Display the navigation URL for the Lightning Experience page for your default org, but don't open the page in a
  browser:

    $ sf org open --url-only --path lightning

  Open a local Lightning page in your default org's Lightning App Builder:

    $ sf org open --source-file force-app/main/default/flexipages/Hello.flexipage-meta.xml

  Open a local Flow in Flow Builder:

    $ sf org open --source-file force-app/main/default/flows/Hello.flow-meta.xml
```

## `sf org resume sandbox`

Check the status of a sandbox creation, and log in to it if it's ready.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org resume sandbox [--json] [-w <value>] [-n <value> | -i <value>] [-l] [-o <value>]

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>      Job ID of the incomplete sandbox creation that you want to check the status of.
  -l, --use-most-recent     Use the most recent sandbox create request.
  -n, --name=<value>        Name of the sandbox org.
  -o, --target-org=<value>  Username or alias of the production org that contains the sandbox license.
  -w, --wait=<minutes>      Number of minutes to wait for the sandbox org to be ready.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Check the status of a sandbox creation, and log in to it if it's ready.

  Sandbox creation can take a long time. If the original "sf org create sandbox" command either times out, or you
  specified the --async flag, the command displays a job ID. Use this job ID to check whether the sandbox creation is
  complete, and if it is, the command then logs into it.

  You can also use the sandbox name to check the status or the --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most
  recent sandbox creation.

ALIASES
  $ sf env resume sandbox

EXAMPLES
  Check the status of a sandbox creation using its name and specify a production org with alias "prodOrg":

    $ sf org resume sandbox --name mysandbox --target-org prodOrg

  Check the status using the job ID:

    $ sf org resume sandbox --job-id 0GRxxxxxxxx

  Check the status of the most recent sandbox create request:

    $ sf org resume sandbox --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the incomplete sandbox creation that you want to check the status of.

    The job ID is valid for 24 hours after you start the sandbox creation.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Username or alias of the production org that contains the sandbox license.

    When it creates the sandbox org, Salesforce copies the metadata, and optionally data, from your production org to
    the new sandbox org.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the sandbox org to be ready.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you and
    returns the job ID. To resume checking the sandbox creation, rerun this command.
```

_See code: [lib/commands/org/resume/sandbox.ts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-org/blob/3.2.1/lib/commands/org/resume/sandbox.ts)_

## `sf org resume scratch`

Resume the creation of an incomplete scratch org.

```
USAGE

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>   Job ID of the incomplete scratch org create that you want to resume.
  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent incomplete scratch org.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Resume the creation of an incomplete scratch org.

  When the original "sf org create scratch" command either times out or is run with the --async flag, it displays a job
  ID.

  Run this command by either passing it a job ID or using the --use-most-recent flag to specify the most recent
  incomplete scratch org.

ALIASES
  $ sf env resume scratch

EXAMPLES
  Resume a scratch org create with a job ID:

    $ sf org resume scratch --job-id 2SR3u0000008fBDGAY

  Resume your most recent incomplete scratch org:

    $ sf org resume scratch --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the incomplete scratch org create that you want to resume.

    The job ID is the same as the record ID of the incomplete scratch org in the ScratchOrgInfo object of the Dev Hub.

    The job ID is valid for 24 hours after you start the scratch org creation.
```
