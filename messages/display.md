# summary

Display information about an org.

# description

Output includes your access token, client Id, connected status, org ID, instance URL, username, and alias, if applicable.

Use --verbose to include the SFDX auth URL. WARNING: The SFDX auth URL contains sensitive information, such as a refresh token that can be used to access an org. Don't share or distribute this URL or token.

Including --verbose displays the sfdxAuthUrl property only if you authenticated to the org using auth:web:login (not auth:jwt:grant).

# flags.verbose.summary
